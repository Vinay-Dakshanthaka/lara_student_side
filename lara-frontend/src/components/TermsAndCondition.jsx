                Whenever you use our web site, or any other web site, the computer on which the web pages are stored
                (the Web server) needs to know the network address of your computer so that it can send the requested
                web pages to your Internet browser. The unique network address of your computer is called its “IP
                address,” and is sent automatically each time you access any Internet site. From a computer’s IP
                address, it is possible to determine the general geographic location of that computer but otherwise it
                is anonymous.
